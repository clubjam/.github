# clubjam - Your sheet music easily organized!
With the clubjam app, your can finally organize your sheet music the way it deserves!
We help all you solo musicians, bands, ensembles and orchestras to organize your sheet music archive. With innovative functionality, an intuitive, fun UI/UX and much love from musicians to musicians we created a new form of sheet music management. By keeping an eye on both physical and digital music archives, we provide all the tools you need for managing your sheet music archive efficiently and intuitively.

## With much love for physical sheet music ...
While many applications just focus on digitalizing sheet music, we at clubjam are aware that many musicians still prefer to have their music notes physically, the old-fashioned way. With that in mind, using a clever QR code system, we invented an intuitive way to organize your physical music note archive effectively and quickly.

## ... while also innovating digital music archives
Using clubjam you can easily create a digital representation of your physical music archives and folders and start uploading digital copies of your sheet music. Share just the folders they need with your fellow music group members and easily give them access to the sheet music voices representing their instrument.

## Invite your music group!
With clubjam you can easily invite your fellow musicians to join the clubjam representation of your music group. By defining who plays which instrument, virtual representations of your music sheets (or lead sheets e.g.) can easily be distributed to your band or orchestra members.

## PDF splitting
With skilled developers and a little bit of magic we created a powerful tool for sheet music digitalization. With clubjam you are now able to split PDFs combining multiple voices for different players automatically and in seconds. Furthermore, every music group member immediately has access to just the voice they need, without any complications. Just give it a try, you won't be disappointed!

## Create appointments and setlists
Using clubjam you are able to create appointments like rehearsals or concerts both for yourself as well as for your music groups. These appointments are visible for your fellow music group members. Furthermore, we let you create setlists using sheet music entries in your archive. Using this feature no musician can ever pick the wrong music sheet again during an event! (Or at least we hope so ^^)

## Created with <3 in Flutter and Firebase
At clubjam we follow a (mostly) single-codebase approach using Dart and the Flutter SDK, with an easily scalable Firebase backend. This allows us to push updates quickly and fix any issues quickly for all supported platforms.
